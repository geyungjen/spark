# Northwind database for Spark SQL

This ER diagram was generated by MySQL workbench, it is there for you to understand the schema, to make join query if needed.

## Getting started:

### Assumption

This is to assume you already have Hadoop, Hive and Spark installed on the master node, and you already have started up Hadoop, Hive, Spark master and worker processes as well have started up Spark thriftserver.  You need them to be up and running.



#### Create Northwind database schema

You can git clone this repo and change directory into the repo folder and run below command:

````bash
nohup spark-sql -f northwind.sql &
````

As result of running above spark-sql query, it will create a database (aka schema) called northwind and will create tables shown in the above ERD under database northwind, then populate these tables with data.

Because it might take some time to complete the northwind.sql, you may want to run it in the background with nohup, in case your ssh gets disconnected.

This also assuming you are inside the folder that has the northwind.sql and spark-sql is in the $PATH
